# Perceptron_SVM_PA
Implementation and comparison between Perceptron, SVM, and Passive Aggressive (PA) algorithms.

The goal is to classify a training set of 3,286 examples between 3 classes. 

The data set is about Abalone age classification. The dataset provides eight features per instance (seven of which are numerical and one is the categorical) and three labels (male, female, infant).
